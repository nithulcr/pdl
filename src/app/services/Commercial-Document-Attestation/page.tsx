                  <p className='font-light'>Commercial documents form the backbone of every business. They reflect a company’s legal identity, financial operations, ownership structure, agreements, and international dealings. When businesses expand into new markets, enter global partnerships, submit tenders, sign contracts, or engage in cross-border trade, commercial documents must be authenticated to maintain legal compliance and official recognition.

                  <p className='font-light'>
                    Commercial attestation is more structured and often more sensitive due to the impact it has on legal and financial operations. It usually involves validation by chambers of commerce, ministries of economy, foreign ministries, and embassies. Each stage verifies a different dimension of the document—its purpose, its issuing authority, its signatures, and its legal binding nature. After embassy legalisation, the document undergoes final MOFA approval in the UAE, enabling it to be used within the legal, corporate, and banking systems.
